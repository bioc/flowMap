CHANGES IN VERSION 1.5.1
------------------------

USER VISIBLE CHANGES

    o Remove functions that support computation of permutation-based p-values of the Friedman-
      Rafsky (FR) statistic,including permutePops() and getFRvalsPerm(). Current release 
      computes p-values of the FR statistic directly from the standard normal curve. 

    o Remove functions for building a reference sample for multiple flow cytometry sample comparisons,
      including makeRefMap() and makeRefSample(). Instead, curent release encourages the user to 
      generate a multi-sample similar matrix of cell populations which can in turn be used to decide 
      on matched or mismatched cell populations

    o Remove getSomePops(), which was used to compute selected cell population pairs in a cross-sample
      comparison. Current release computes the FR statistics for all possible cell population pairs 
      in a cross-sample comparison.
